# Elastic JS

This is wrapper for the official library, elasticsearch-js, that I created for quick use. The official library has not good enough documentation and I spent time to understand how to use it. So here it is the library that more intuitive for me and it has unit tests that show all examples that can be used as a reference.

Wrapper use Elasticsearch-js v5 and elasticsearch v5 as well. When I create this wrapper, elasticsearch's latest version is 8 but I stick to v5 because I follow a pluralsight tutorial.
